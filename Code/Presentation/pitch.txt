# Adaptive retail:

## Case story

Traditional shops are facing increasing competition from online retail [1]. There are, hovewer multiple opportunities to improve the in-shop experience with:
- tailoring the customer journey to the needs of a specific person
- using the resources more effectively to reduce frustrations and save costs

we have identified two areas which could potentially be improved in typical middle-size discount supermarkets (like Netto), especially in Denmark, leveraging existing infrastructure.
- Queue lines are long due to a high cost of staff, which needs to multitask. Queue optimization an waiting time decrease can improve customer retention: according to study performed by 77% of shoppers are less likely to return to a store where they experienced long checkout lines and 19% of shoppers walk away, if the waiting line has more than 5 people in it.

- Customers are often overloaded with choice and miss either personal assistence present in the smaller shops or online recommendations given by AI-assistans present in Amazon etc.


We plan to improve: value proposition (performance) and aim for better customer relationship.
